                        <div class="px-4 pb-4">
                            <p>In JavaScript, users can declare a variable using 3 keywords that are var, let, and
                                const. In this article, we will see the differences between the var, let, and const
                                keywords. We will discuss the scope and other required concepts about each keyword.

                                var keyword in JavaScript: The var is the oldest keyword to declare a variable in
                                JavaScript.

                                Scope: Global scoped or function scoped. The scope of the var keyword is the global or
                                function scope. It means variables defined outside the function can be accessed
                                globally, and variables defined inside a particular function can be accessed within the
                                function.</p>

                        <div class="px-4 pb-4">
                            <p>An arrow function is also known as the fat arrow function. It is a new feature introduced
                                in ES6 that is a more concise syntax for writing function expressions. Both regular
                                JavaScript functions and arrow functions work in a similar manner but there are some
                                differences between them. Let's see the differences below: - <br>

                                Syntax
                                Arguments binding
                                Use of this keyword
                                Using a new keyword
                                <br>
                                <span class="font-bold text-yellow-300">1) Syntax:</span>
                                A programmer can get the same result as regular functions by writing a few lines of code
                                using arrow functions.
                                <br>
                                Curly brackets are not required if only one expression is present.
                                <br>
                                <span class="font-bold text-yellow-300">2) Arguments binding</span>
                                arguments object inside the regular functions contains the list of arguments.
                                The arrow function, on the opposite, doesn’t define arguments i.e. they do not have
                                arguments binding.
                                But you can easily access the arrow function arguments using a rest parameter <br>
                                <span class="font-bold text-yellow-300">3) Use of this keyword</span>
                                Inside of a regular JavaScript function, this value is dynamic. The dynamic context
                                means that the value of this depends on how the function is invoked.
                                The behavior of this inside of an arrow, function differs considerably from the regular
                                function’s this behavior as an arrow function does not have its own “this” keyword.<br>

                                The value of this inside an arrow function remains the same throughout the lifecycle of
                                the function and is always bound to the value of this in the closest non-arrow parent
                                function which means No matter how or where being executed, this value inside of an
                                arrow function always equals this value from the outer function.<br>
                                <span class="font-bold text-yellow-300">4) Using a new keyword</span>
                                Regular functions are constructible and callable. They can be called using the new
                                keyword.
                                But, the arrow functions are only callable and not constructible, i.e., arrow functions
                                can never be used as constructor functions.<br>
                                <span class="font-bold text-red-300">Summary</span>
                                this value inside a regular function is dynamic and depends on how the function is
                                invoked. But this inside the arrow function is bound lexically and equals to this of the
                                outer function. Fat arrow methods always bind this a value to the class instance.

                                and divide each element by 10, then assign our new array containing the new cost to the
                                variable newCost. <br>

                                .filter() checks every element in an array to see if it meets a certain criteria and
                                returns a new array with the elements that return truthy for the criteria. <br>

                            should you use template string?</summary>
                        <div class="px-4 pb-4 space-y-2">
                            <p>Template strings are a powerful feature of modern JavaScript released in ES6. It lets us
                                insert/interpolate variables and expressions into strings without needing to concatenate
                                like in older versions of JavaScript. It allows us to create strings that are complex
                                and contain dynamic elements. Another great thing that comes with template strings are
                                tags. Tags are functions that take a string and the decomposed parts of the string as
                                parameters and are great for converting strings to different entities. <br>

                                The syntax for creating template strings is by using backticks to delimit them. For
                                example, we can write: <br>

                                <mark>`This is a string`</mark> <br>
                                This is a very simple example of a template string. All the content is constant and
                                there are no variables or expressions in it. To add variables and or expressions to a
                                string, we can do the following.
                            </p>
